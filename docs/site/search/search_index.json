For additional info on how to deploy the user guide, check the official guide . Update the user guide To update the user guide, follow these steps: Run the docker-compose.docs.yaml configuration: (root) \u279c docker-compose -f docker-compose.docs.yaml up Open the browser at http://localhost:9000 . Change the documents within the docs/docs folder (this will trigger an auto-reload that will automatically perform changes in the UI) Build the user guide To build the user guide, follow these steps: Run the docker-compose.docs.yaml configuration: (root) \u279c docker-compose -f docker-compose.docs.yaml up SSH into the docs container: (root) \u279c docker exec -it docs sh Build the user guide by running the command: /code # mkdocs build this command will build the user guide into the docs/site folder. This folder can then be used for deployment purposes(this can be deployed, for instance, using an S3 bucket). Markdown syntax (WIP) In this section we report an optimal set of markdown samples that are useful in the creation of the user guide. Lists These are some lists examples: First item Second item Third item Indented item Indented item Fourth item Open the file containing the Linux mascot. Marvel at its beauty. Close the file.

However, the auto-reload feature is not fully working with docker and that's why we are suggesting to create a local virtual environment to update the user guide.","title":"MKDocs"},{"location":"mkdocs/#mkdocs","text":"In this section we will briefly explain how to use MKDocs to update the user guide within this repo.
